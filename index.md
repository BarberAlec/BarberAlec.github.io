## About Me
Keen interest in Bayesian methods, History and Software Development.

Masters and undergrad from Trinity College Dublin in Electonic and Computer engineering. Specific research focus on statistical signal processing and previously telecoms. Currently working with UTIA (Institute of Information Theory and Automation) in Prague with Prof. Anthony Quinn, working towards a conference publication.

I am targeting a career in either a financial algorithmic trading role or a developer/researcher of AI applications and tools.
