## An Analysis of Othello AI Strategies

**Project description:** Othello is an interesting game in the domain of artificial intelligence due to a somewhat unexpected level of complexity. Simplified versions of the game on a 6x6 and 4x4 versions of the board have been solved, but no full solution has been found for the classic 8x8 board and above. This letter surveys a number of state-of-the-art approaches to Othello game playing including CNNs and adversarial models. Performance is measured against computational efficacy, model memory size and Monte Carlo simulation against a benchmark greedy algorithm. A further investigation into  heuristics is also presented. Results indicate that the adversarial models outperform the CNN but is highly dependant on the heuristics adopted. A further analysis on Bayesian and reinforcements methods is provided.

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
